# Bike Service Application

This bike service application streamlines scheduling and managing bike maintenance, featuring secure user authentication, service booking, and profile management. Users can choose from various service packages, receive real-time notifications, and engage with animations and popup messages for actions like successful bookings. When a service or package is booked, both the owner and customer receive emails with booking details and confirmation, respectively. The frontend uses React.js, styled with Tailwind CSS, and tools like EmailJS, React-toastify, Framer Motion, and React-lottie. The backend is built with Node.js and Express.js, using MongoDB with Mongoose for the database and Bcrypt.js for password encryption, while Firebase stores contact information.
